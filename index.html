		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<hr>

		<p>
			Hello! I am an aspiring developer living in Lake Mary, FL.  I moved down from New Bedford, MA in the Summer of 2006.  My high school years were spent at one of the top Vocational Schools in the state, majoring in Computer Information Technology.  I received a baseball scholarship out of high school and obtained an AA in Business Administration.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon graduation I was offered a position to become an estimator for a large landscape company in Orlando.  Within the next year and a half, I was able to build my portfolio and become the Head Estimator at the age of 21.  Within the next few years, I built my team to grow the construction division to be one of the largest in the state and along with the other divisions we became a Top 100 Landscape Company in the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a few successful years and company growth, my family was offered to become partners with a smaller company on the outskirts of Orlando called Natureâ€™s Care of Orlando.  The company was severely struggling and almost out of business but showed real promise.  After much thought, we decided to take the offer.  Within 3.5 years, we turned this small four hundred-thousand-dollar annual revenue company with a handful of employees into a 3.5-Million-dollar annual revenue company with 48 employees, running satellite offices in Jacksonville, FL and Tampa, FL.
		</p>
		<p>
			After years of success in the Landscape Construction and Maintenance Industry, I am turning back to my passion of computer technology and web development.
